# Font_Blanc_C
## Overview
Font_Blanc_C is an unconventional encryption algorithm which uses matrix multiplication to permute, or reorder, data stored in a byte-array.  

For encryption, the program takes a file and encryption key as input and outputs a second file which contains the reordered bytes of the input file. The output file contains all the bytes of the input file, but in meaningless order. Internally, the algorithm performs linear transformations on the file data with permutation matrices generated from the encryption key.  
The only way to decrypt a file is to perform the reverse linear transformations generated by the key used for encryption. Using a different key for decryption will generate different permutation matrices and will therefore arbitrarily reorder the data again instead of returning it to its meaningful order.  

The program has built-in multipass encryption, supporting up to 10 layers of encryption. Each layer may use a different key and either encrypts the file in fixed-sized chunks (faster) or variable-sized chunks (more secure).

## Terminology
The following terms show up in this documentation and are defined here in context of the program.  
| Term | Definition |  
| ---: | :--------- |
| Linear tranformation | A function which takes a vector as input and outputs a vector mapped to a different (linear) vector space[<sup>1</sup>](#endnotes). In this case, the function is multiplication by a matrix. |
| Orthogonal matrix | A square matrix whose inverse is equal to its transpose. |  
| Permutation matrix | An orthogonal matrix which, when multiplied with a vector, interchanges the rows of the vector with each other[<sup>2</sup>](#endnotes). The content of the vector is preserved, but the order of the contents is not. |  
| Dot product | A mathematical operation which takes two equal-length vectors and returns a single number. Denoted `a⋅b`, for some vectors `a` and `b`. |
| Matrix inverse | The inverse of matrix M, denoted M⁻¹, is the matrix such that multiplying M with M⁻¹ equals the identity matrix, I. M⁻¹M = I. |  
| Data integrity check | All linear transformations by an orthogonal matrix preserve dot product. For a data vector `d`, an arbitrary "check" vector `c`, and an orthogonal permutation matrix `M`, `d⋅c = Md⋅Mc`[<sup>3</sup>](#endnotes). Therefore, the integrity of some encrypted data can be checked by comparing the dot products of the data with an arbitrary "check" vector before and after they have been transformed. | 
| Instruction | A user defined rule which completely describes a single pass of encryption. It necessarily includes the encryption key and the permutation matrix dimension and can include further options such as data integrity checks. |  
| Multipass encryption | The process of encrypting a file multiple times in sequence. Also called multilevel encryption. |  

## Theory  
### Using Linear Transformations to Encrypt Data
The Font_Blanc_C algorithm is predicated on the fact that the multiplication of a vector with an invertible matrix can be perfectly reversed by multiplying the resultant vector with the inverse of said invertible matrix.  

    Theorem A:
    For some invertible matrix M, and some vectors a and b, it is true that
    Ma = b and M⁻¹b = a  

Consider the byte array containing a file's data to be a vector of length n, where n is the number of bytes in the file. If we create an inveritble n-dimensional square matrix, M, and multiply it with the file vector, the resultant vector will be a transformed (encrypted) version of the data. By Theorem A, to reverse the transformation (decrypt the data) we have to calculate the inverse of M and then multiply it with the encrypted data vector. However, despite the fact that this is a functional encryption process, in practice it is too computationally expensive to 1) generate an arbitrary invertible matrix from an encryption key and 2) calculate its inverse.  

Is there a way to harness the simple encrypt and decryptability of a vector via linear transformation outlined in Theorem A without the use of expensive algorithms?  

Permutation matrices to the rescue! Permutation matrices are orthogonal by definition, meaning their transpose is also their inverse. Calculating the transpose of a square matrix has a time complexity of O(n), a vast improvement over calculating inverse which cannot be done in less than O(n<sup>2</sup>) time[<sup>4</sup>](#endnotes). Therefore, an algorithm that can efficiently generate unique permutation matrices from encryption keys would solve both problems.  

### Encryption in Chunks
Creating a permutation matrix the size of the length of an input file would be ideal because it would result in a true reordering of bytes. However it is far too computationally expensive to generate a matrix that large and perform matrix multiplication with it. To combat this, the Font_Blanc_C algorithm splits an input file into discrete chunks and then uses permutation matrices to reorder the bytes in each chunk. The file can either be split into chunks of the same dimension, or chunks of pseudo-random variable dimension determined by the encryption key. Encrypting a file using fixed-dimension chunks is faster because no more than 2 permutation matrices ever need to be generated to encrypt the entire file irrespective of its length. Encrypting a file using variable-dimension chunks is more secure because the dimension of each chunk is derived from the encryption key. This means that a brute force attack attempting to reorder the bytes in each chunk would be significantly harder since the start and end of each chunk is unknown without the encryption key.

Encrypting in chunks is less than ideal because it means that reordered bytes stay relatively close to their original position, but it's a necessary compromise for efficiency. The issue can be mitigated to some extent by performing multiple passes of encryption using a mix of differing fixed-dimension passes and variable-dimension passes.  

## Performance  
### Independent Variables and Testing Methodology
To measure performance, I've defined 2 major sections of the program whose elapsed execution times will be anlalyzed:  
1) the generation of permutation matrices
2) the execution of linear transformations (matrix multiplication)   

For all tests I used [this]() PDF of the U.S. Constitution named `Constitution.pdf`. The test file, as it will be referred as, is 4488706 bytes (4.3 MiB) long. All tests were run on a 4-core, 8-thread, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @ 2.7GHz. All testing was done in file encryption because decryption is expected to have the same performance. The data presented here for each experimental group is the average result of 5 runs.  

### Single Threaded Benchmark
The following table is the result of the control test. Specifically, a single pass of single-threaded, variable-dimension encryption on the test file. The command ran:
    
    $ ./fontblanc Constitution.pdf -e -k keyfoobar  
    
| Measured Section | Time (ms) | Proportion of Runtime (%) |  
| :-------------- | :-------: | :----------: |  
| Generating matrices | 707.27 | 87 |  
| Linear transformations | 60.63 | 7.5 |  
| Rest of program | 45.02 | 5.5 |  
| Elapsed time | 812.92 | 100 |  

This data shows that the generation of permutation matrices takes up the largest proportion of runtime and is therefore the area that optimization efforts should be focused.

### Multithreading the Generation of Permutation Matrices
To increase the performance of generating the permutation matrices, I decided to employ multithreading. I designed 2 multithreading schemes, pthread-permut and pthread-permut-join. Both schemes schedule the generation of each matrix to a new thread, but pthread-permut does not synchronize the completion of the threads, while pthread-permut-join does.  

For fixed-dimension encryption, I expect a speedup of no more than 50%, because only 2 matrices have to be generated and they can both be done in parallel. The graph below shows how both schemes perform. Displayed is the number of threads vs elapsed time for three passes of fixed-dimension encryption.

## Usage
Run with `fontblanc <input filepath> <options ...>`.  

### Execution Flags
The initial command to run the program will contain the file to operate on, global flags, and, optionally, the first instruction. If the first instruction isn't contained in the initial command's arguments, then the program will automatically start in interactive instruction input mode.  
| Flag | Description |
|:----:| :---------- |
| h    | Print general help. |
| e    | Run in encrypt mode. |
| d    | Run in decrypt mode. |
| t    | Set max number of threads to use. Expects argument. If not invoked, defaults to single-threaded. For efficient performance, set to the number of cores on the machine's CPU. For maximum performance on hyperthreaded CPU's, set to number of cores multiplied by number of threads per core. |
| o    | Set output filename (uses input filepath). Expects argument. If not invoked, defaults to input filename. Adds prefix (decryption) or extension (encryption) to output filename to prevent overwriting the intput file. |
| m    | Run in interactive instruction input mode (multilevel encryption/decryption). |
| v    | Verbose output. Prints information for debugging. |
| k    | Set encrypt key for first instruction. Expects argument. |
| D    | Set permutation matrix dimension for first instruction. Expects argument. Argument of 0 denotes variable-dimension encryption. If not invoked, defaults to variable-dimension encryption. |
| s    | Skip data integrity checks for fist instruction. Not recommended. |

### Instruction Flags
Instruction flags are options used to define a single encryption/decryption rule in the interactive instruction input loop.
| Flag | Description |
|:----:| :---------- |
| h    | Print instruction help. |
| k    | Set encrypt key for current instruction. Expects argument. |
| D    | Set permutation matrix dimension for current instruction. Expects argument. Argument of 0 denotes variable-dimension encryption. If not invoked, defaults to variable-dimension encryption. |
| s    | Skip data integrity checks for current instruction. Not recommended. |
| r    | Delete last instruction. |

A generic instructions is written in the form of:  
`-k <some key> -D <some dimension>`  
Omitting the `k` flag prompts the user to type the encryption key into the terminal with keyboard echoing disabled.  

### Example: Simple
The following command runs a single pass of encryption over the file `Constitution.pdf` using the key`fookeybar`. It encrypts using variable-dimension permutation matrices since the `D` flag was not invoked. It outputs a file named `Constitution.pdf.fbz`.  

    $ ./fontblanc Constitution.pdf -e -k fookeybar

    File name: Constitution.pdf

### Example: Intermediate
The following command runs a single pass of encryption over the file `Constitution.pdf` using the key`fookeybar`. The output filename is set to `Constitution_encrypted` and it runs using a maximum of 4 threads. It encrypts using variable-dimension permutation matrices since the `D` flag was not invoked. It outputs a file named `Constitution_encrypted.fbz`. 

    $ ./fontblanc Constitution.pdf -e -o Constitution_encrypted -t 4 -k fookeybar

The following command decrypts the file generated by the previous encryption command, but using 8 threads instead of 4. It outputs a file named `d_Constitution.pdf`.

    $ ./fontblanc Constitution_encrypted.fbz -d -o Constitution.pdf -t 8 -k fookeybar
    File name: Constitution_encrypted.fbz

    Done.  
    
### Example: Multipass Encryption
The following command instructs the program to enter the instruction input loop for multipass encryption via the `m` flag. It runs using a maximum of 4 threads.  
The first instruction is defined in the program execution arguments and states to perform variable-dimension encryption using the key `fookeybar`.  
The second instruction is defined in the instruction input loop and states to perform variable-dimension encryption using the key `barkeybaz`.  
The third instruction is defined in the instruction input loop and states to perform fixed-dimension encryption using a permutation matrix size of 4096 using the key `bazkeyqux`.   
It outputs a file named `Constitution.pdf.fbz`.  

    $ ./fontblanc Constitution.pdf -e -t 4 -k fookeybar -m
    File name: Constitution.pdf
    File size: 4488706 bytes
    Mode: encrypt
    Threads: 4

    | Instruction #1 |
    Key: fookeybar
    Matrix dimension: variable
    Data integrity checks: on

    Enter an instruction using options "-k" "-D" "-s":
    $ -k barkeybaz

    Matrix dimension: 4096
    Data integrity checks: on

    Enter an instruction:
    $ done

    Encrypting...
    Executing instruction 1...
    Executing instruction 2...
    Executing instruction 3...
    Elapsed time (s): 0.697083
    Done.  
    
The following command decrypts the file generated by the previous encryption command. Notice that in this example the user only defines the dimension for each instruction, so the user can type their encryption keys with keyboard echoing disabled (keystrokes are shown in the transcript for purpose of readability, but text enclosed in angle brackets would be masked in a terminal). It outputs a file named `d_Constitution.pdf`.

    $ ./fontblanc Constitution.pdf.fbz -d -t 4 -D 0 -m
    File name: Constitution.pdf.fbz
    File size: 4488706 bytes
    Mode: decrypt
    Threads: 4
    $ Enter key: <fookeybar>    // Masked input

    | Instruction #1 |
    Key: fookeybar
    Matrix dimension: variable
    Data integrity checks: on

    Enter an instruction using options "-k" "-D" "-s":
    $ -D 0
    $ Enter key: <barkeybaz>    // Masked input

    | Instruction #1 |
    Key: fookeybar
    Matrix dimension: variable
    Data integrity checks: on

    Enter an instruction:
    $ done
    
    Decrypting...

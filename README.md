## Usage
Run with `fontblanc <input filepath> <options ...>`.  

### Execution Flags
Execution flags are options used in the initial command to run the program. If the first instruction isn't contained in the initial command's arguments, then the program will automatically start in interactive instruction input mode.
| Flag | Description |
|:----:| :---------- |
| h    | Print general help. |
| e    | Run in encrypt mode. |
| d    | Run in decrypt mode. |
| t    | Set max number of threads to use. Expects argument. If not invoked, defaults to single-threaded. Recommended to set to the number of cores on the machine's CPU. |
| o    | Set output filename (uses input filepath). Expects argument. If not invoked, defaults to input filename. Adds prefix (decryption) or extension (encryption) to output filename to prevent overwriting the intput file. |
| m    | Run in interactive instruction input mode (multilevel encryption/decryption). |
| k    | Set encrypt key for first instruction. Expects argument. |
| D    | Set permutation matrix dimension for first instruction. Expects argument. Argument of 0 denotes variable-dimension encryption. If not invoked, defaults to variable-dimension encryption. |
| s    | Skip data integrity checks for fist instruction. Not recommended. |

### Instruction Flags
Instruction flags are options used to define a single encryption/decryption rule in the interactive instruction input mode.
| Flag | Description |
|:----:| :---------- |
| h    | Print instruction help. |
| k    | Set encrypt key for current instruction. Expects argument. |
| D    | Set permutation matrix dimension for current instruction. Expects argument. Argument of 0 denotes variable-dimension encryption. If not invoked, defaults to variable-dimension encryption. |
| s    | Skip data integrity checks for current instruction. Not recommended. |
| r    | Delete last instruction. |

A generic instructions is written in the form of:  
`-k <some key> -D <some dimension>`  
Omitting the `k` flag prompts the user to type the encryption key into the terminal with keyboard echoing disabled.  

### Simple Example
    $ fontblanc Constitution.pdf -e -k fookeybar

    File name: Constitution.pdf
    File size: 4488706 bytes
    Mode: encrypt
    Threads: 1

    | Instruction #1 |
    Key: fookeybar
    Matrix dimension: variable
    Data integrity checks: on

    Encrypting...
    Elapsed time (s): 0.816374
    Done.  

This command runs a single pass of encryption over the file `Constitution.pdf` using the key`fookeybar`. It uses variable-dimension encryption since the `D` flag was not invoked and outputs a file named `Constitution.pdf.fbz`.  

    $ fontblanc Constitution.pdf.fbz -d -k fookeybar

    File name: Constitution.pdf.fbz
    File size: 4488706 bytes
    Mode: decrypt
    Threads: 1

    | Instruction #1 |
    Key: fookeybar
    Matrix dimension: variable
    Data integrity checks: on

    Decrypting...
    Elapsed time (s): 0.801153
    Done.  
  
This command decrypts the file generated by the previous encryption command. It outputs a file named `d_Constitution.pdf`.
